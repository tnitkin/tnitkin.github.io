<p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
<p>I am writing to express my strong interest in your Data Science opportunity. My 20+ years of experience span statistical modeling, healthcare analytics, and full-stack ML Ops deployment—skills I’ve applied across public health, clinical settings, and AI innovation. Most recently at IntelliDyne, I led LLM integration into Flask-based analytics apps using Azure Databricks, producing structured outputs from unstructured data. I’ve developed tools that generate automated narratives from LLM prompts, applied NLP pipelines for real-time reports, and built containerized ML pipelines monitored in production.

I also bring deep expertise in health claims data, having led RCM analytics and CPT/ICD-based modeling to evaluate clinical and financial outcomes. With additional background in behavioral modeling and SMART-trial-aligned mixed-effects analyses, I’ve helped translate data into meaningful insights across clinical, pharmaceutical, and social sectors. I’ve published peer-reviewed work on behavioral and health interventions and developed Python tools for reproducible analyses—packaged with documentation for internal distribution.

You’ll find me a versatile and collaborative team member—someone who delivers fast, well-documented code, contributes meaningfully to cross-functional discussions, and communicates results visually and verbally. I’m excited about the prospect of helping your team advance impactful health solutions through AI and statistical insight.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I’d welcome the chance to contribute to your mission.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Dr. Todd A. Nitkin</p>
