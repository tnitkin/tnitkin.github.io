    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my strong interest in your Data Science position. With over 20 years of experience in statistical modeling, healthcare analytics, data product development, supervised and unsupervised learning, and end-to-end ML Ops deployment. I bring a rare blend of technical and clinical expertise, including Python and R programming, supervised and unsupervised learning, and end-to-end ML Ops deployment. I have trained large language models (LLMs) on structured and unstructured datasets, developed scalable ML pipelines, and applied spatial data with tools like GIS and Azure Databricks to power real-world decision-making systems.

At IntelliDyne, I lead Python and Flask development for large-scale analytics solutions, integrating GIS, Power BI, and LLM-based reporting to support geospatial and environmental decision-making. I’ve built production-ready ML pipelines using scikit-learn, XGBoost, and TensorFlow, incorporating containerized deployment and real-time monitoring. Previously at World Vision and Medical Teams International, I designed global program information systems and built KPI-driven dashboards that supported strategic planning across 90+ countries.

My strength lies in turning complex data into clear, visual insights that support organizational goals. I have implemented end-to-end ML Ops pipelines, including training models on Big Data platforms like Spark and Databricks, using Git-based version control, containerization (Docker), and deploying models into production.

Additionally, my background includes healthcare data expertise, including EMR systems, claims data, and clinical outcome modeling, and I have successfully applied these analytics methods across multiple industries. I have years of experience with writing and communication. I would be happy to discuss how my teaching role at Johns Hopkins and my published research can contribute to your team’s goals.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team’s goals through clear, data-driven innovation.

Warm regards,</p>
<p>Dr. Todd A. Nitkin</p>
